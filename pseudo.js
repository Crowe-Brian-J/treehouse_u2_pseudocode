/*
--- Notes for Pseudocode ---

--terms/definitions

* Logic - the order in which the program runs, the decisions made within the program, and how you structure the different parts of the program

* Syntax - the actual programming language (i.e. "let score = 0" in js would be "int score = 0" in C#)

(Should probably have done this in a .txt file instead of a js file)

--what is pseudocode?

* generally a set of instructions you write to yourself in something closer to plain English:

print "What is your name?"
input name
set applicantName to input
print "What is your GPA?"
input gpa
set applicantGPA to input
if applicantGPA is less than 0 or more than 6:
  print "Not a valid GPA, try submission again"
  end
elseif applicantGPA is 3 or more:
  set applicationStatus to high
endif
store applicantName and applicantGPA in database
